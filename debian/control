Description:  AWS exploitation framework, designed for testing the security of Amazon Web Services environments. 
 Pacu is an open-source AWS exploitation framework, designed for 
 offensive security testing against cloud environments. Created 
 and maintained by Rhino Security Labs, Pacu allows penetration 
 testers to exploit configuration flaws within an AWS account, 
 using modules to easily expand its functionality. Current modules 
 enable a range of attacks, including user privilege escalation, 
 backdooring of IAM users, attacking vulnerable Lambda functions,
 and much more.
